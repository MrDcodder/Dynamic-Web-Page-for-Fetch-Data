Static site generators are capable of pre-generating the HTML pages. As static sites aren't dependent on servers to create HTML codes, they result in quicker load times.

Static websites are also more scalable as you can supply the website straight from a web server or a CDN. There are a couple of popular static site generators in the market. Make sure you choose the most suitable one for your business.

25. Automation cloud testing
One important aspect of the web development process in the automated testing age is the current trends in web development. This can only be achieved via extensive testing and cross-browser compatibility validation.

The majority of individuals do not access the Internet using the same browser. Hence, it's possible that a dispersed target audience uses several browsers to visit the website.

In order to increase Time-To-Market (TTM), it is imperative for businesses to guarantee faster test execution times. Considering the variety of platforms, browser versions, and browsers available, you need to make an investment in scalable and trustworthy testing infrastructure!

Cross-browser tests may be executed using automation testing by creating test scripts with a well-known framework such as Selenium. As a result, it can now execute and scale tests as needed. Using a cloud-based Selenium Grid for parallel testing reduces test execution time while increasing test and browser coverage.

26. Data compliance
As a business owner, you need to take enough precautions to protect your customer data. Without proper data regulations, you're making the data items vulneravle to breach. If something happens and your customer data gets stolen, it's the end to your reputation and professionalism.

Remember that cyber attackers never stop. And as a website owner, you must handle the customer data responsibly. Besides incident management, you need to train to team to make sure no data breaches take place.

Also, different countrues have different rules regarding data compliance standards. If your target customers are from the Europe, you need to follow GDPR protocols.

Make sure you follow the local and global data protection laws. This way, you can avoid any long-term legal problem from taking place. Investing in data compliance is one of the most important factors, making it the latest web development technologies on my list.

27. 3D elements

Web developers must optimize their websites for these metrics in order to improve user experience and website presence in search engine results. Here are some tools to determine core web vitals:

PageSpeed Insights
Lighthouse
Google Search Console
New Core Web Vitals
29. Server-side rendering
The process of rendering web pages on the server and sending them to the client as finished HTML pages is known as server-side rendering. Faster page loading, improved SEO, and increased accessibility for users on devices with poor processing power or weak internet connections are just a few benefits of this approach.

Large-scale, complex web applications that require a lot of dynamic content benefit from SSR. Instead of waiting for client-side scripts to load and execute, developers may render pages on the server to guarantee that visitors receive a fully-formed page quickly and efficiently.

Just a few of the frameworks and tools available for creating SSR include Next.js and Nuxt.js. SSR is expected to gain popularity as a web development trend in 2024 as need for faster and more efficient online apps grows.

30. Headless CMS architecture
A headlness CMS architecture allows you to develop and use apps without handling the infrastructure administration. As a developer, you can freely create and deploy your code.

However, remember that you would be requiring a cloud service provider. They need to install a server for the apps, databases, and storage system to function.

Scalability is one of the most iconic parts of headless CMS architecture. You can scale the apps up or down as per the demand of the users. This way, you can handle traffic increases without any infrastructure limitations.

31. Meta frameworks
In the web development industry, meta-frameworks—also called multi-frameworks—are becoming more and more well-liked. In order to give developers access to the greatest features of each framework in a single project, they integrate various frameworks.

This approach can streamline, accelerate, and improve the quality of the code by letting developers utilize the best tool for the job at hand.

Meta-frameworks are especially useful for large-scale projects because multiple teams may be working on different sections of the application using different frameworks. Even when employing alternative meta-framework technologies, the various teams can work together with ease.

Among the well-known meta-frameworks are Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Nest.js. These frameworks combine different technologies, such as React and VueJS, to give developers a smooth development experience. As new technologies and frameworks keep emerging, we should expect to see a growth in meta-frameworks in the future.
